# advancedreactor
This is a series of Python codes modelling some typical applications in chemical reactors ranging from cracking reactor to bioreactors
This is a part of requirement for graduate-level chemical reaction engineering course

The codes involve using RK4 to model some common problems in the industry such as ethylene cracking (isothermal and nonisothermal), catalytic cracking, and fermentation.
Later on, the codes were simplified using built-in package scipy.
